          using the Egain solution is to deflect customer emails by 60% and also
          resolve 88% of customer issues through self-service. Other benefits
          will include a reduction in training time for contact centre agents,
          an improvement in the contact centre agent time to competency and cost
          saving due to better knowledge access and diagnosis by agents.
