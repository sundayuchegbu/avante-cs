              eGain’s chatbot provides the frontline support so your customer
              service staff can concentrate on more complex tasks. A customer
              simply chats with the virtual assistant (also called VA, virtual
              agent, or chatbot), like they would with any human agent. The chat
              bot not only understands the words but also the intent, thanks to
              a portfolio of AI technologies that include machine learning and
              reasoning. The virtual assistant provides answers to any queries,
              even helping in shopping decisions. At any point, and if the need
              arises, it can seamlessly escalate to agent-assisted channels like
              chat.
